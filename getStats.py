# data_types = [ ('pt_record', 'S32'),
#                ('proc_id', 'u4'),
#                ('user_id', 'S32'),

# Medical Records:
mr = dframe[dframe.app=="MR"]

# TODO:
# - basic stats on total_minutes: avg, max, mean
# - common workflows: group by activity, count locks, get top
#   - group by activity, sum times, get top
#   - corr/cov between activities, so we know which are more likely to effect others?
# - "slowest" users: group by user, average times, get outliers & compare with averages
# - "sticky" workstations: group by workstation, average times, get outliers


# Other Apps:
other = dframe[dframe.app!="MR"]

# - should these be compared against the MR locks? e.g. does REG lock out MR?
# - any use in comparing these against each other?


# External Info:
# - any value in extracting user's departments?
# - what about dividing into 3 shifts (based on secs_since_midnight)?
#   - might that tell us which need more training
#   - interesting to see locks which overlap the shift change

# LEARN:
# - Â¡most important! is when 2 users are trying to view the same patient at the same time -- how to do this???
